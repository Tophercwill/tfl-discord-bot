*An unending gray drizzle sends a wave of melancholy through the city. Puddles form in every open crevice and lightly flood the streets.*
*Stinging rain pelts down like daggers, sending a freezing chill through all those who stand outside for long. Most citizens remain in the warmth of their homes, safe from the downpour.*
*Sheets of rain fall occasionally throughout the day. Faint sunbeams break through the dark clouds, only to be washed away by another deluge.*
*The rain is calm, yet constant. It is comfortably warm, and dries up by nightfall.*
*There is the faintest drizzle that creates a light fog through the streets, bathing the city in a calm glow.*
