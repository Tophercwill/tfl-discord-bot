*Heavy winds buffet the city from the east, launching away anything not affixed to something solid. Occasionally, one can see a loose market stall that had been caught by the wind.*
*From the north comes a great oppressive wind, threatening to knock over anyone outside the high walls of the city.*
*A dense wind blows in from the sea, tossing up loose trash and paper through the city streets. It sends a slight whistle through the tight alleys in the denser districts.*
*From the south come turbulent gusts that shake the forest to its core. Its great trees shake with every rush, sending the animals to hide in their holes.*
