*Heavy white clouds of swirling smoke fill the sky, and it rains ash that coats everything in little flecks. A smell of burning wood and sulphur permeates the air, and it is difficult to see or breath unprotected in the city streets.*
*At 2:00 PM today, the two moons in the sky align with the sun. For an hour, the city is bathed in darkness, and those who gaze upon the event can spy slight tendrils of colored lightning spring from each celestial body.*
*At night, stars begin to fall from the sky as lumps of stone and metal. Deep into the night, one strikes the heart of the forest, flattening hundreds of trees and sending up a cloud of dust visible for miles.*
*Fluctuations in the weave drive strange flashing lights and odd phenomena sweeping across the sky. Rain falls upwards, plants bloom unseasonable, and people see apparitions of the dead and gone. Those in contact with the weave of magic can feel an unsettling feeling wash over them, as they find their spells more potent, yet more prone to bursts of unexpected magic.*
